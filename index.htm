<h2>Workshop Overview</h2>

<p>These notes are for a half-day workshop introducing <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> to <a href="http://www.ncl.ac.uk/">Newcastle University</a> <a href="http://www.ncl.ac.uk/biomedicine/">Medical School</a> postgraduate research students.  The workshop is next scheduled to run on Tuesday 21st April 2015, but if you can't make it, you are free to work through the notes yourself and get <a href="mailto:conor.lawless@ncl.ac.uk">in touch</a> with me if you have any questions.</p>

<h3><a href="http://lwlss.net/talks/SciPyIntro">Introduction</a> & Motivation</h3>

<p>Modern biological research involves <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v498/n7453/full/498255a.html">a lot of data</a>, usually stored on a computer.  As scientists, we want to extract the maximum amount of information possible from our data.  Writing and executing computer code is an extremely flexible and powerful way to do this, making good use of the impressive computing power and fast network connections currently at our disposal.</p> 

<p>Unfortunately, programming has not been part of many biological researchers' training.  All research scientists should have some computational tools at their disposal to help with the capture, handling, processing and analysis of data.  Solely <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/80">relying on Microsoft Excel</a> (as an example) for analysis is highly restrictive and expensive.  Learning to program can remove some fairly heavy constraints on the way we think about research.  Accounting software like Excel is not capable of carrying out advanced analysis and simply doesn't help with time-consuming tasks such as file formatting, image manipulation or text manipulation, which are often important parts of the research workflow.</p>

<p>Fortunately, programming is something you can become good at without formal training.  Modern programming languages like Python make issuing instructions to computers easier than ever before. Outside of programming books, excellent <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python">online courses</a> and Q&A <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2573135/python-progression-path-from-apprentice-to-guru">forums</a> make learning quite straightforward and enjoyable.  Interestingly, in a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015#profile-education">2015 survey</a> of expert and professional software developers, the most common self-reported classification for "Education" was "I'm self-taught"!</p>

<p>Many biological research scientists spend hours or days on repetitive, computer-based tasks which could easily be automated away if they had a few basic programming skills.  Worse still, some tasks that could easily be automated are not even attempted because of the perceived amount of manual computer work involved.  Getting to grips with a little bit of programming will help you to work more efficiently by improving your ability to plan and carry out research.</p>

<h3>The Python programming language</h3>

<p><a href="http://python.org">Python</a> is a friendly, powerful, flexible <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open-source</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language">programming language</a> with many freely available add-ons which allow it to easily handle an incredibly diverse range of data types in a consistent manner.  Code written in Python is probably the most readable of any popular programming language.</p>

<p><a href="http://python.org">Python</a>'s functionality overlaps with that of many other tools, including <a href="http://www.wolfram.com/products/mathematica/">Mathematica</a>, <a href="http://www.mathworks.co.uk/products/matlab/">Matlab</a>, <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">R</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29">Java</a>, but <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> has some advantages over all of these.  Compared to <a href="http://www.wolfram.com/products/mathematica/">Mathematica</a> and <a href="http://www.mathworks.co.uk/products/matlab/">Matlab</a>, <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> is a true programming language which is capable of doing more than just mathematical analysis (although these tools are designed specifically for mathematical analysis, and are sometimes preferable). <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">R</a> is similarly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open-source</a> and freely available, and although powerful and useful, <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">R</a> was designed for statistical analysis rather than general programming.  As a result, <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">R</a> syntax (or language structure) is not as clean, consistent, simple and easy to read as that of <a href="http://python.org">Python</a>.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29">Java</a> are more powerful (faster, more efficient) programming languages  but it is much more difficult to write and identify errors in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29">Java</a> code.  <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> code is clean and simple.  Python programs are quite powerful.  It is relatively difficult to make mistakes when writing code in Python.</p>  

<p>Both <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> and <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">R</a> are distributed under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open-source</a> licenses, which is important for sharing of scientific results.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">Open-source</a> means that anyone, anywhere with an internet connection can access and install the tools necessary to use, test or develop published code.  As computer code is an increasingly important part of biological research, universal, free access greatly increases the <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/reproducibility/">reproducibility</a> of research.  <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/reproducibility/">Reproducibility</a> is a fundamental component of the scientific method.  Universal access, enabled by open-source software, is also convenient for code developers (you & I), allowing us to reuse code on our personal machines, or on colleagues machines without the need for expensive licenses or specific permissions.</p>

<h3>R can be a good alternative to Python</h3>

<p><a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">R</a> is a programming environment designed for statistical analysis.  It shares several of <a href="http://python.org">Python</a>'s best features, in particular it is an open source programming tool.  It handles spreadsheet-like numerical data easily and contains powerful tools for statistical analysis, and in many ways is preferable to <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> for pure data analysis.  However, <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> syntax is cleaner, simpler and better structured, making it easier to learn.  <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> is also more flexible, adaptable and powerful (and therefore much more fun).  For these two important reasons, learning <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> is a much better way to begin to program than attempting to learn <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">R</a>.</p>  

<p>Having said that, if you do have a little previous programming experience, or, after this course if you have come to grips with some programming concepts and are interested in learning about another amazing tool, I thoroughly recommend the excellent <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">R</a> courses run by the school of <a href="http://www.ncl.ac.uk/maths/">Maths & Stats</a> here at Newcastle:  <a href="http://www.ncl.ac.uk/maths/rcourse/">http://www.ncl.ac.uk/maths/rcourse/</a></p>

<h3>Objectives</h3>

<p> After completing this course on Scientific Computing with Python, you should be able to:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/conor.lawless/ScientificPython/Installation/">Install</a> <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> onto your own computer.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/conor.lawless/ScientificPython/FirstScript/">Write</a> some simple <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> scripts</li>
<li><a href="http://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/conor.lawless/ScientificPython/Execution/">Execute</a> <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> scripts in a variety of ways (e.g. command-line, <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> GUI, Windows shortcuts)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/conor.lawless/ScientificPython/Libraries/">Find and install</a> <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> libraries which are appropriate for your particular research problem by searching online</li>
<li><a href="http://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/conor.lawless/ScientificPython/Structure/">Understand</a> basic programming structure (variables, types, loops, functions, logic) enough to allow you to continue to learn independently</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these steps will be motivated by practical (and hopefully useful) example code which is included in these notes.  By the end of the workshop you will see that it is easy to write simple code and that writing code is a powerful and flexible way to make efficient use of computers.</p>

<p>Some further tools and resources are highlighted in the <a href="Resources">Other Resources</a> section.  In particular, this page includes links to more advanced Python tutorials for continued learning.</p>
