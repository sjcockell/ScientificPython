		<h3>Workshop objectives:</h3>

		<p>Overall the goal is to be in a good position to continue learning to program with <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> independently.  Specific steps for the workshop will be to:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Install Python</li>
		  <li>Write some very simple Python scripts</li>
		  <li>Run Python scripts in a few different ways</li>
		  <li>Understand basic programming commands</li>
		  <li>Find and install libraries for extending Python</li>
		 </ul>
		 </p>
		 <p>Learning by doing is probably the best way to advance with programming, and it's fun and satisfying.  There are lots of <a href="http://bsu.ncl.ac.uk/ScientificPython/Resources/">online resources</a> for continued learning.</p>

	  <article>
        <h3>Why is programming important for bioscience?</h3>
		<ul>
		  <li>Much biological data are electronic (e.g. <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=microscopy+images&hl=en&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X">microscopy images</a>, <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=microscopy+images&hl=en&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X">medical scans</a>, genome sequences, log files)</li>
		  <li>Digital data are best stored and analysed by computer</li>
		  <li>Modern computers: incredibly powerful, but underutilised by biologists</li>
		  <li>Learning a programming language allows humans to command computers</li>
		  <li>Digital literacy increasingly important for efficient science (e.g. <a href="http://py4science.strawlab.org/">py4Science</a> at <a href="http://www.viennabiocenter.org/">Vienna Biocenter</a>)</li>
		  <li>Independence from commercial software developers</li>
		  <li>Even basic familiarity increases productivity of multi-disciplinary research</li>
		</ul>
      </article>

	  <article>
        <h3>Why Python specifically?</h3>
		<ul>
		  <li>Free to install on any computer, at no cost (independence)</li>
		  <li>Python is multi-platform (Windows, OSX, Linux)</li>
		  <li>Skills developed are fully transferrable</li>
		  <li>Open to other researchers (reproducible science)</li>
		  <li>Python syntax is very clear</li>
		  <li>Python is easily extensible</li>
		  <li>Writing Python code is fast</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Open, easy to learn, easy to use</h2>
      </article>

        <h3>Why not R?</h3>
		<ul>
		  <li><a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">R</a> is also awesome</li>
		  <li>There are some great <a href="http://www.ncl.ac.uk/maths/rcourse/">R courses</a> at Newcastle</li>
		  <li>R is also free, open source and extensible</li>
		  <li>However, R syntax is ugly: difficult to read and write</li>
		  <li>Developed for statistical programming (for which it is excellent)</li>
		  <li>R was not developed for general-purpose computing</li>
		  <li>I use both, swapping between Python and R</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Relatively difficult to learn.  Easier to learn to program with Python first.</h3>
      </article>

	  <article>
        <h3>What about other programming languages?</h3>
		<ul>
		  <li>Some other languages are more powerful: generate programs that run more quickly (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java">Java</a>)</li>
		  <li>Syntax is more verbose and more difficult to learn</li>
		  <li>C++, C, Java are less "safe": easier to make mistakes, more difficult to debug</li>
		  <li>I use C++, but increasingly less often, as development is much slower than in Python</li>
		  <li><a href="http://www.wolfram.co.uk/mathematica/">Mathematica</a> and <a href="http://www.mathworks.co.uk/products/matlab/">Matlab</a>: tools for applied maths & data visualisation however they require costly licenses</li>
		  <li><a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> is an older open source language but notoriously difficult to read and learn</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Powerful, but expensive, verbose, ugly or less "safe".  Easier to learn to program with Python first.</h3>

        <h3>Three example Python scripts for the lab</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Manually counting cells at the microscope (<a href="https://gist.github.com/CnrLwlss/5330159">code</a>)</li>
			<li>Manually counting Colony Forming Units (CFUs) on agar <a href="http://biology.clc.uc.edu/fankhauser/labs/microbiology/Yeast_Plate_Count/Yeast_Plate_Count.htm">plates</a> (<a href="https://gist.github.com/CnrLwlss/5330143">code</a>)</li>
